# higherorlow
Simple rest api to implement a card game called “HIGHER OR LOWER”. 

The dealer shuffles a deck of 52 cards, draws the first card, and places it on the table. The first player guesses if the next card will be higher or lower than the one on the table. The player wins if he guessed correctly (if the card had the same face value, it counts as a win).
